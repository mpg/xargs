            Defining commands with many optional arguments made easy

Presentation
------------

Defining commands with an optional argument is easy in LaTeXe. There is,
however, two limitations: only one argument can be optional and it must
be the first one. The xargs package provide extended variants of
\newcommand & friends, for which these limitations no longer hold. It
allows to control what happens with many consecutive optional arguments.
It also provide a way of making the definition global.

Some features of xargs are similar to those provided by the experimental
`xparse' package, which also allows more flexible argument syntaxes,
though the approach and syntax are different.  However, xargs is not
experimental, so I hope it can be useful while waiting for a stable
LaTeX3 release.
