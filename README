            Defining commands with many optional arguments made easy

Presentation
------------

Defining commands with an optional argument is easy in LaTeXe. There is,
however, two limitations: there can be at most one optional argument and it must
be the first one. The xargs package provide extended variants of \newcommand &
friends, for which these limitations no longer hold.

You may know some tricks in order to define commands with many optional
arguments, or with last argument optional, etc. Theses tricks are subject to a
few problems (using arguments in arbitrary order can be difficult, sometimes
space is gobbled where it should not), which can be difficult to solve.  Anyway,
you don't want to worry about such tricky things while writing a document.

The xargs package provides you with an easy and (hopefully) robust way to define
such commands, using a nice key=value syntax.
